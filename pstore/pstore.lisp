;;;; COMMIT-RECORD
;;;
;;; A commit record is for recovery of the database.
;;; When a restart occurs (because of a crash or otherwise)
;;; the most recent commit record is located and the transient
;;; data is restored from this record.
;;;
;;; We don't keep track of where the most recent commit
;;; record is, we scan for it on restart.  It therefore has
;;; to be unique.  We use a message digest at a fixed offset
;;; to mark the record.
