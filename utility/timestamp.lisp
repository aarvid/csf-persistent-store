;;;
;;; TIMESTAMP
;;;
;;; In order to allow persistent and non-persistent use of timestamps with a minimum of fuss,
;;; they're implemented as lists of two integers.  The first integer is UNIVERSAL-TIME
;;; measured in seconds in an ANSI specified canonical form.

;;; Unfortunately, lisp doesn't offer a more granular absolute time mechanism.
;;; GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME is good for relative sub-second measures, in increments
;;; of INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND (which is 1000 in Franz Allegro 5 on NT).
;;; Still, even then, sufficiently fast execution will yield the same value in two calls
;;; to this measure.
;;;
;;; We therefore use a per-process counter which measures successive calls
;;; uniquely to TIMESTAMP-ALLOCATE so that at least no two sequential calls in a
;;; process will show the same counter.
;;;

;;; Implementation notes:
;;;   A timestamp may have a null sequence number.  This is because
;;;   users are allowed to create timestamps from universal times.
;;;   Timestamps with a null sequence number are considered later than
;;;   any other timestamp in that particular second, but equal to all
;;;   other timestamps in that second with null sequence numbers.
;;;   This has two important advantages:
;;;
;;;   1.  Timestamp equivalence is transitive:  if a = b and b = c,
;;;       then a = c.
;;;
;;;   2.  Timestamps are reasonably ordered: if a < b and b < c, then
;;;       a < c.
;;;
;;;   3.  User generated timestamps being later than the computer
;;;       generated ones, user specified times are inclusive rather
;;;       than exclusive intervals.  (This is probably the desired
;;;       behavior).

;;; within some time interval that was specified by the user (and
;;; whose timestamp universal times will have been specified upon

;;; should always provide it, even if one means to use the current
;;; time.  This is because we need some means of distinguishing
;;; whether the timestamp needs to be a unique monotonically
;;; increasing value (in the case of database events) or whether it is
;;; just being constructed to bound some time interval.
