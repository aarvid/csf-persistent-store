;;;; What a mess!
;;;; Turns out that it is pretty damn hard to get the case preserved pathname out of NT.
;;;; The only function that will reliably do it is DIRECTORY.  (No, there is no function
;;;; in the WinAPI that does it, I checked.)  So given a file, the only way to get the
;;;; case preserved name of it is by calling DIRECTORY on the parent directory and
;;;; searching the resulting list for the filename.
;;;; However, calling directory will not give you the preserved case on the directory itself.
;;;; The only way to get that is to call directory on the PARENT of the parent
;;;; directory, and so on up to the root.
;;;; The difficulty is trying to escape the combinatoric explosion that would happen
;;;; if we did this the naive way.
;;;;
;;;; So here's the plan:
;;;;  NT-PRESERVE-PATHNAME-CASE will crawl up the directory tree and get the case
;;;;  preserved names of each of the components of the directory.
;;;;  When we expect to be calling nt-preserve-pathname-case on a *lot* of pathnames,
;;;;  like when we are processing a directory, we call CALL-WITH-DIRECTORY-CACHING.
;;;;  This function caches the results of calling directory on a pathname, and
;;;;  NT-PRESERVE-PATHNAME-CASE knows to look in the cache.
;;;;  The cache is flushed at the end of call-with-directory-caching, so it will not
;;;;  get too stale or too big.

;;;;  I've added some support for matching `FOOBAR~1'-like pathnames, but it is
;;;;  even uglier.
